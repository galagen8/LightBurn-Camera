<h1>LIGHTBURN CAMERA INSTALLATION</h1>
</br> </br>
Old laser RUIDA doesn't have camera at all. It uses RDWorks software and this software never give you access to Controller. 
So, you can't move, you can't create layers, you can't do many things, only cut. Lighburn can reveal all possibilities 
of your old machine. With Lightburn you can even see what you cut - needed just to install camera and set it up properly.
