<h1>LIGHTBURN CAMERA INSTALLATION</h1>
</br> </br>
Old laser RUIDA doesn't have camera at all. It uses RDWorks software and this software never give you access to Controller. 
So, you can't move, you can't create layers, you can't do many things, only cut. Lighburn can reveal all possibilities 
of your old machine. With Lightburn you can even see what you cut - needed just to install camera and set it up properly. 
</br> </br>
I found this camera on some marketplace, it was pretty cheap = 23$: </br>

Using bending and cutting machines I got that:

It can turns around 2 axis around 80 degree and it just enough for this purpose. To manufacture it I used steel and transparent acrylic.
About preffered mounting distance from the table, Lighburn settings and camera calibration etc. you can find 2 pdf manuals stored in "MANUALS" directory.

For mounting the camera I've built rectangular aluminum support:

And this is how camera window looks in Lightburn:
