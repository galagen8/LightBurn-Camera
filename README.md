<h1>LIGHTBURN CAMERA INSTALLATION</h1>

Old laser RUIDA doesn't have camera at all. It uses RDWorks software and this software never give you access to Controller. 
So, you can't move, you can't create layers, you can't do many things, only cut. Lighburn can reveal all possibilities 
of your old machine. With Lightburn you can even see what you cut - needed just to install camera and set it up properly. 
</br> </br>
I found this camera on some marketplace, it was pretty cheap = 23$.</br> 
Camera name: Camera 5MP USB 160deg Wide-Angle OV5640 2592X1944 Fixed-Focus.  </br>
I think this camera can be easily found on any marketplace:

I've provided the drawing of this small PCB:

Using bending and cutting machines I got that:

It can turns around 2 axis around 80 degree and it just enough for this purpose. To manufacture it I used steel and transparent acrylic.
</br>
About preffered mounting distance from the table, Lighburn settings and camera calibration etc. you can find 2 pdf manuals stored in "MANUALS" directory. </br></br>
**ALSO ONE NOTE:**  wide angle cameras like this (160 degrees) aren't easy to calibrate, it takes some time. If you laser table isn't very big - I would recommend you to try any USB camera with narrower angle - for example, you can start from 120 degrees camera.

</br>
For mounting the camera I've built rectangular aluminum support:

And this is how camera window looks in Lightburn:

Thank you for your attention and I hope it helps!
